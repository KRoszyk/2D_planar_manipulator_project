# Planar robot control project with 2 degrees of freedom

This is a university project in which I have implemented the following controllers for a planar robot with 2 degrees of freedom:
- Active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) 
- Feedback linearization controller (FLC)
- A proportional-derivative controller (PD)
- Mass adaptive controller (MMAC)

Each controller has own script so you can just run them to try how they work. 
After activating each of the controllers, you can see the robot arm movement graph and the trajectory tracking graph. 

If you have any questions, just leave a comment or write to me a message. :)
